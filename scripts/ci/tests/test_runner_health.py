"""runner.sh health: which of the two queueing causes this box is in.

"Queued for six minutes" has two causes with opposite fixes — the box is
thrashing, or every GitHub listener is busy — and nothing printed both, so
they were guessed at. The API half is stubbed here (a real `gh` would answer
about the real repo); the load, thread count, CPU-slot pool and process counts
are read from the machine the test runs on, which is the point: they must be
read, not invented.
