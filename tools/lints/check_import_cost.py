"""Import-cost budgets for the layers that are supposed to be cheap.

A constants module that costs 1.6 s to import is not a constants module. The
cost is never local either: `import app.constants.llm` pulled transformers,
langchain_core and langsmith, so every test session, every worker boot and
every `python -c` that touched it paid for a model library it never used.

Two budgets, both discovered rather than listed, so a new file is covered the
moment it exists:

- every module under app/constants, app/config, app/utils and app/models is
  imported ALONE in a fresh subprocess, and its cost is its own body plus
  everything it is the first to import — which is exactly what `-X importtime`
  reports as the cumulative column for the root of a lone import.
- the three entry points every process starts from get a budget of their own.

No package names appear here, and there is no baseline. A heavy dependency is
caught the moment it reaches a hot path, which is the only place it costs
anything; where it may be imported FROM is the static half, and belongs in
[tool.importlinter]'s layers contract rather than in a list here.

Usage::

    python3 tools/lints/check_import_cost.py            # check (exits 1 on failure)
    python3 tools/lints/check_import_cost.py --report   # print every cost, gate nothing
