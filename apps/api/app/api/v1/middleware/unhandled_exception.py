"""Catch-all that turns a crash into the envelope while CORS can still see it.

Starlette answers an uncaught exception in ServerErrorMiddleware, which wraps
the whole application — outside CORSMiddleware. The 500 envelope it returns
therefore carries no Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so a browser refuses to read
it. This middleware is added innermost, inside CORS, and converts the exception
there; the outer handler stays as a last resort.

Pure ASGI, not BaseHTTPMiddleware: the latter re-raises through its own task
group and would reintroduce the layering this exists to avoid.
