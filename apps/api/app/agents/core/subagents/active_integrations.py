"""Per-conversation record of in-context activated integrations.

``activate_integration`` stamps the integrations it loads; ``retrieve_tools``
discovery reads the set and searches those namespaces too, so tools beyond
the preloaded subset are actually discoverable from the activating run.
Without this, activation's "use retrieve_tools for the rest" points at a dead
end: discovery otherwise searches only the caller's own tool space.

Storage only — namespace mapping lives with the reader. Stamped solely on the
successful-activation path (which gates on the connection check), so a member
implies the user is entitled to it; custom MCPs never stamp (they route to
handoff instead). Every Redis absence degrades to "nothing active" with a
warning rather than failing the caller.
